    <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
    <p>This is a classic Jewish casserole dish that is perfect for big family gatherings.
        It can be made sweet or savory, but I prefer the sweet version, so this will be a
        recipe for making a sweet kugel, which is perfect as a creamy, carb-heavy dessert. 
        People with diabetes should be cautious around this dish.</p>
    <p><h4>Ingredients</h4></p>

    <p><h4>Steps</h4></p>
    <p><h5>Make the Kugel</h5></p>

        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the noodles until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, use an electric hand mixer or rotary beaters to beat together the butter, cream cheese, and sugar until smooth.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs and vanilla, and beat until well mixed.</li>
        <li>Pour in the milk and beat just until smooth.</li>
        <li>Stir the drained noodles into the egg mixture. Add the raisins, if using, and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Pour into the prepared pan and smooth the top with a spatula. </li>
    </ol>
    <p><h5>Make the Topping and Bake</h5></p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine the cereal, melted butter, sugar, and cinnamon. Stir to combine. Sprinkle the topping evenly over the kugel.</li>
        <li>Bake in a heated oven for 1 1/4 hours or until the kugel is puffed, set in the center, and golden on the bottom.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and allow to cool on a rack for 15 to 20 minutes before cutting into squares to serve. </li>
    </ol>
